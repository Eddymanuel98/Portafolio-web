            <summary>What is your educational background?</summary>

            <summary>Why web development and programming?</summary>
                <p>As a kid, I was always interested in technology. It wasn’t until I was 12 that I got my first PC, thanks to my father. When that happened, I became fascinated with this world and decided to study it. However, it was not possible due to the lack of a proper school in my area.</p>

            <summary> How have you learned web development?</summary>
            <p>I am self-taught. I started studying programming once I left my country, taking it a few steps at a time. I learned by reading documentation pages, watching YouTube videos, and using every tool at my disposal.</p>
